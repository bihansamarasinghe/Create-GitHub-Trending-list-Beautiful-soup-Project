## Overview

The script utilizes the `requests` library to make an HTTP GET request to the GitHub trending page. It then uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content and extract information about trending repositories. The script collects the repository names and their corresponding links and presents them in a structured format.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the script:

- [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/): To make HTTP requests.
- [`BeautifulSoup`](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/): To parse HTML content.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the [`main.py`](script.py) file.

2. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will initiate the scraping process and display the trending repositories along with their links.
